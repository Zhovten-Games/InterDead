  "stories.slide1.body": "That elderly sibyl—chalk whispering across the séance ledger like frost etching a window—outlived the room that rejected her, yes; but only in the arithmetic by which one postpones an eclipse by minutes. She sat at the rim of that dim island of furniture, eyes filmed with the mathematics of absence, and when the door finally unlatched and the daylight made its small, embarrassed apology, she gathered her implements as a nurse gathers the names of the newly deceased. If the house did not swallow her then, chronology did: a later winter, an unremarkable bed, and the same slow breath that once propelled automatic writing dwindling to a pencil-thin hush. I count her as lost, and the ledger—yellowed to transparency—agrees.",

  "stories.slide2.body": "Holly, whose pulse was a tuning fork for the unseen, entered the farmhouse like a lit match carried into a bottle; the phenomenon responded not with conversation but with pressure, that primitive grammar of air and negation. Instruments skittered, thresholds folded, and the invisible asserted itself with the clumsiness of a god in a barn. What remained afterward was not spectacle but subtraction: the team’s geometry refigured around an absence where a person had stood, the data recording nothing so eloquently as the last, clipped syllable of her name. She did not survive; the house, at last, had learned to breathe without her.",

Yet the asylum requires no credentials to recognize edible fear. Before he could unloose his careful confession (that he saw nothing, that he merely calibrated the audience), the corridor announced him to the resident geometry, and the geometry replied with an embrace that tightened to a thesis. He was unmade with the efficiency reserved for liars and novitiates: throat closed, horizon tilted, camera aghast. Even counterfeit keys will turn a door, provided the door is hungry.",

  "stories.slide4.body": "Elise Rainier walked the Further as if it were a workplace and not a borderland, bringing from that noctilucent archive the names of things that stifle children. Her fall—inevitable in the sense that all lamplight summons moths and some moths bring teeth—did not conclude her; it converted her to grammar. She is now the clause invoked when terror must be called by its Christian name, the citation murmured when a room grows too quiet. If I work at all, it is because she taught me how to knock—twice for courage, a third time for truth. And though she has fallen, she remains the northing on my compass, the breath I borrow when corridors lengthen.",

  "faq.a1": "— Is communion with a specific dead person possible?\nYes, though not in the crude bookkeeping sense by which the living hope to pin labels upon the abyss. No deceased dissolves into the general noise; each becomes a persistent “knot”—a topological pleat of memory and will, outlined as sharply as an address on the rusted telegraph of night; and any call sent into that dusk will be intercepted by someone. The rule is thus: it is not the desired one who answers, but the coincident—the one whose frequency, perimeter, and residual geometry of pain most exactly overlay the shape of your request in that moment. Hence “specificity” appears in the result rather than being guaranteed by intention: the channel chooses its interlocutor as the tide chooses its shore.\n\nConclusion (practical, oddly enough): try more often. Vary the phase of address, record time and wording, keep a log of mismatches and brief “parasitic” replies; by accumulating iterations you tighten the contour of coincidence, and the likelihood of speaking with the very one you need grows not by the grace of luck but by the law of repetition. Regularity is the chief candle in this anachronistic laboratory.",
